# FriendBot - Molly Gilson and Matt Morris
 Project for State Farm's "Good Neighbor" challenge for UGA HACKS 8.
## Inspiration
Everyone needs someone to talk to, but sometimes nobody is around ! We built this so that people may use it and find clarity based upon how they are feeling!
## What it does
FriendBot askes the user how they are feeling, and responds accordingly with words of encouragement, solutions, and link to additional resources so that user may better their understanding. 
## How we built it
We built the project entirely in java, using the Console as a means to communicate back and forth. 
## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was making sure the bot didn't crash or break if the user inputted unfamiliar language to the bot. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we we're able to make this, and while it isn't very big or elaborate yet, we think it's simplicity is easy to understand and easy to use. 
## What's next for FriendBot
FriendBot currently only has 10 emotions, and it's responses aren't very deep. We would love to increase the ways FriendBot can respond, so it can be give more elaborate and detailed responses , as well as increase the amount of emotions it can respond to.
